> The programmer can concentrate on the general program logic, without bogged down in the syntactic details of the individual instructions. In fact, this entire process might be repeated serveral times, with more programming detail added at each stage. Once the overall program strategy has been clearly established, then the syntactic details of the language can be considered. Such an approach is often referred to as "top-down" programming.

程序员可以专注于程序的整体逻辑，而不必拘泥于每一个~~语句~~ 指令的语法细节。事实上，这整个过程可能会重复很多次，在每一个阶段都会添加更多的编程细节。一旦明确了程序的总体策略，就可以考虑该语言的具体语法细节了。这样的方法经常被称为“自顶向下”编程。

> Manufacturing processes may be classified as unit production with small quantities being made and mass production with large number of identical part being produced.

制造过程可以被分类为两种：一种是只生产少量产品的单位生产，另一种是大量生产相同零件的大批量生产。

...分为....，一种是....，另一种是....。前者指.....，后者指.....。

> Many elements in nature are found to be mixtures of different isotopes.

~~很多的元素都在自然界中以不同种同位素混合的形式被发现。~~

> Telerobots: When a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it's dangerous, far away, or inaccessible, teleoperated robots, or telerobots are used. Rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements a telerobot is controlled from a distance by a human operator. The robot may be in another room or another country, or may be in a very different scale to the operator. A laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery, sinificantly shortening recovery time. An interesting use of a telerobot is by the author Margaret Atwood, who has recently started using a robot pen to sign books remotely. At the other end of spectrum, iRobot ConnectR robot is designed to be used by another one to stay in touch with family or friends from far away. Still another robot is being used by doctor to communicate with patient, alllowing the doctor to be anywhere in the world. This increased the number of patients a doctor monitor.

远程控制机器人：当人类由于工作场所危险、过于遥远或者无法进入而无法直接在现场进行工作时，远程操控的机器人便有了用武之地。远程控制机器人不是按照预定的轨迹进行移动，而是由在远程的人类控制员进行操控。机器人可能处于另一个房间或者是国家，也可能具有相对于操作者不同的尺度。 与开放式手术相比，腹腔镜手术机器人能够使外科医生在患者体内进行较小尺度上的操作，从而极大的缩短了患者的术后恢复时间。作家玛格丽特·阿特伍德~~将远程操控机器人用于另一个有趣的用途~~发现了远程操作机器人的另一种妙用，她最近开始用机械笔来远程~~给书签名~~签售作品。另一方面，iRobot的ConnectR机器人旨在供人们方便的与远方的亲人和朋友联系。此外，还有一种机器人被用于使~~处于世界任何地方的~~医生能与处于世界任何地方的病人进行交流，这使得每个医生能够~~帮助~~*监护*的病人数量增加了。

> ANTHROPOLOGISTS have found that polyandry—the union of one woman and more than one man—is a rarity in humans. Across thousands of studied societies, just a few dozen polyandrous cultures exist, widely scattered around the world. For the most part, the guess is that cultural factors are at work. Among rodents, however, the practice is both widespread and well understood: it cuts down on infanticide. Males who have not sired with a given female will kill her newborns to prevent the spread of his rival's genes, and to free her from the burden of raising another's young in favor of his own.
>
> In a classic sexual arms-race case, the practice of polyandry won out. Males cannot distinguish their own young from a rival's, so a female that gives birth to young from more than one male will have protected them all from any individual father's aggression, lest he threaten his own offspring.

人类学家发现，一妻多夫制（一个女人和多个男人结合）在人类社会中很少见。在成千上万个研究过的社会中，只有少数几种一妻多夫文化，他们广泛的分布在世界各地。大多数情况下，对于这种形式存在的猜想是文化因素。但是，在啮齿动物中，这种做法既普遍且广为人知：它减少了杀婴的行为。没有与雌性繁殖后代的雄性会杀死其新生儿来防止其竞争对手将基因传递下去，同时使雌性免于抚养另一个幼体以抚养自己的后代。

在一个典型的性竞赛案中，一夫多妻制制度胜出了。 雄性无法将自己的年幼后代与竞争对手的区别开来，因此，拥有多个雄性伴侣的雌性生下的后代，雄性伴侣可以保护其免受其他父亲的侵害，以免威胁到自己的后代。

## 5 Bats

> &nbsp;&nbsp;Not all sounds made by animals serve as language, and we have only to turn to that extraordinary discovery of echo-location in bats to see a case in which the voice plays a strictly utilitarian role.
>
> &ensp;&ensp;To get a full appreciation of what this means we must turn first to some recent human inventions. Everyone knows that if he shouts in the vicinity of a wall or a mountainside, an echo will come back. The further off this solid obstruction, the longer time will elapse for the return of the echo. A sound made by tapping on the hull of a ship will be reflected from the sea bottom, and by measuring the time interval between the taps and the receipt of the echoes, the depth of the sea at that point can be calculated. So was born the echo-sounding apparatus, now in general use in ships.
>
> &ensp;&ensp;Every solid object will reflect a sound, varying according to the size and nature of the object. A shoal of fish will do this. So it is a comparatively simple step from locating the sea bottom to locating a shoal of fish. With experience, and with improved apparatus, it is now possible not only to locate a shoal but to tell if it is herring, cod, or other well-known fish, by the pattern of its echo.
>
> &ensp;&ensp;It has been found that certain bats emit squeaks and by receiving the echoes, they can locate and steer clear of obstacles -- or locate flying insects on which they feed. This echo-location in bats is often compared with radar, the principle of which is similar.

&ensp;&ensp;动物发出的声音不只具有作为语言交流载体的作用。我们只需要了解一下有关蝙蝠回声定位的非凡发现，就可以看出声音在这个案例中具有非常重要的现实意义。

&ensp;&ensp;为了清楚的解释这意味着什么，我们可以先看看人类近几十年来的发明。每个人知道，如果一个人在山脚下或者朝着山壁大声叫喊，就会产生回音。发声者离固体障碍物越远，回音返回所消耗的时间越长。如果通过敲击船体产生一个声音，这个声音经过海底的反射会产生一个回音。通过在某一点处测量从敲击船体到收到回声的时间间隔，可以计算出改点的海洋深度。由此，回声测量仪诞生了。现在这种仪器在各种船舶上被广泛使用着。

&ensp;&ensp;每一个固体物体都会反射声音，而回声的具体特性则与物体的大小和性质有关。鱼群也具有这样的特点。因此，从定位海洋底部到定位鱼群的位置，这是一个比较简单的步骤。现在，凭借经验和改进了的回声测量仪，我们不仅能够确定鱼群的位置，而且能通过回波特征来确定是鲱鱼、鳕鱼还是其他鱼类。

&ensp;&ensp;研究发现，有一些蝙蝠会发出尖叫，通过接收回声，它们可以找到并避开障碍物，或者确定它们赖以为生的昆虫的位置。蝙蝠的回声定位常常被与雷达相比较，而这两者的原理有相似之处。

## 6 Of warming and warnings

>&ensp;&ensp;“SCIENCE has spoken,” said Ban Ki-Moon, the UN’s secretary general. “Time is not on our side. Leaders must act.” He was reacting to the latest assessment of the state of the global climate by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of scientists who advise governments.
>
>&ensp;&ensp;Rajendra Pachauri, the IPCC's chairman, agreed. “We have little time before the window of opportunity to stay within 2°C of warming closes,” he said. (Governments have promised not to let global temperatures rise by more than that amount compared with pre-industrial levels.) Bill McKibben, an American climate campaigner, went for broke, calling the report “just short of announcing that climate change will produce a zombie apocalypse, plus random beheadings, plus Ebola”.
>
>&ensp;&ensp;The assessment, it should be said, is sobering. But it does not justify alarmism.
>
>&ensp;&ensp;...
>
>&ensp;&ensp;Correction: An earlier version of this article suggested that the “severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts” mentioned by the IPCC would only occur in its worst-case projections. In fact, the report makes no such qualification. Sorry.

&ensp;&ensp;联合国秘书长潘基文说道：“科学已经表明了，时间并不在我们这边。各国领导人都应该采取行动。” 这是他对政府间气候变化专门委员会（IPCC）对全球气候变暖的最新评估报告作出的回应。

&ensp;&ensp;IPCC主席拉金德拉·帕乔里对此表示赞同。他说道：“在保持升温幅度在2摄氏度的机会之窗关闭之前，我们的时间不多了。”（各国政府已经承诺不会让全球气温上升总幅度超过工业化之前的水平。）美国气候活动家比尔·麦克基本则大发雷霆，称这份报告无异于宣布气候变暖将“造成一场僵尸危机，外加随机斩首，外加埃博拉疫情”。

&ensp; &ensp;这份报告应该说是非常发人深省的，但它不应该成为危言耸听的依据。

&ensp;&ensp;...

&ensp;&ensp;更正：本文的早期版本认为IPCC报告所提及的“严重、普遍和不可逆转的影响”只有在最坏的情况下才会发生。事实上，该报告并未做出这样的限定。抱歉。

> &ensp;&ensp;For decades it has been known that animals can be ‘vaccinated’ against cancer. This is how it works: Tumor cells can be weakened and injected like a vaccine into a mouse. Afterwards, if these same tumor cells, at full strength, are injected into the mouse, the mouse will reject the tumor cells and cancer will not develop. However, if a mouse has not been vaccinated in this manner, the tumor cells will “take root” and the mouse will develop cancer.
>
> &ensp;&ensp;Although it was clear that animals could be vaccinated against cancer, for a long time it was not known how it worked. Then about 25 years ago, a graduate student named Pramod Srivastava began a series of experiments. He took tumor cells, broke them open, and separated the different parts of the cells into fractions. He then used each of the fractions as “vaccines” to see which fraction protected the mice from developing cancer. After many experiments, he found that the element responsible for protecting the mice was heat shock proteins.

&ensp;&ensp;几十年来，人类已经发现动物能够接种防癌疫苗。以下是操作流程：肿瘤细胞可以被削弱，然后像疫苗一样注射到小鼠体内。之后，如果将相同种类但未经削弱的肿瘤细胞注射到小鼠体内，小鼠会排斥这些肿瘤细胞，从而不会患上癌症。然而，如果小鼠没有按照这种方法接种疫苗，肿瘤细胞就会在小鼠体内“生根”，小鼠就会患上癌症。

&ensp;&ensp;尽管动物可以接种疫苗是众所周知的事实，但在很长一段时间里，它的工作原理不为人知。然后，在大约25年前，一位叫普拉莫德·斯里瓦斯塔瓦的研究生开始了一系列实验。他将肿瘤细胞裂解，将细胞的不同部分分离成各种组分([亚细胞分级分离](http://www.labome.cn/method/Subcellular-Fractionation.html))。然后他把这些组分作为“疫苗”，从而观察是哪些组分能保护小鼠不患癌症。经过多次实验，他发现具有保护作用的组分是热休克蛋白。

## 8 The others may live

> IT IS a solemn custom in science to mark the names of collaborators who pass away during the course of an article's publication with a superscript no different than that indicating their academic affiliation. Very rare indeed is the case that five names on a single report should share that mark. Such a report was published in Science this week. It demonstrates the astonishing speed at which genetic sequencing can now be carried out. At the same time, the fact that Ebola claimed five of its authors is testament to the deadliness of the paper's subject.

科学界有一个庄严的习惯，就是[将论文出版期间去世的合作作者的姓名用特殊的符号上标加以标注][1]，而不只是像一般情况一样指出作者的工作单位。事实上，在一篇论文中有5个作者的姓名上都有这样的标记的情况是十分罕见的。本周的《科学》杂志上就发表了这样一篇论文。该论文展示了现在基因测序能以惊人的速度进行。于此同时，埃博拉病毒夺走了5名作者的生命，这证明了该论文主题的致命性。

> Mass is to be distinguished from weight, which is measured by the pull of gravity on a body.

重量与质量是不同的概念，重量是用重力对物体的拉力来衡量的。

> Stainless steel, which is very popular for its resistance to rusting, contains large percentage of chromium.

~~不锈钢是一种因不易生锈而广受欢迎的材料，它的铬元素含量很高。~~

具有突出防锈性能的不锈钢含有大量的铬元素。

> The interpretation, which is not entirely convincing, is at least partly true.

这种解释并不能完全让人信服，但至少其大部分是正确的。

> Cancer should be suspected in persons who have any if symptons and signs for unaccountable causes and for an unreasonable period.

~~对于因不明原因，在不合理的时期出现上述种种症状和体征的人，都应该怀疑是罹患了癌症。~~

如果病人具有任何上述症状和体征，病因难以说明，且持续时间过长，就应该怀疑病人患了癌症。

> World population is increasing at a race with which foos and other production may not be able to keep pace.

~~世界人口正在以粮食和其他产品产能可能无法跟进的速度增长。~~

世界人口正在迅速增长，使得粮食和其他产品的产能跟不上其增长速度。

> Language policies for the judiciary should not deny justice. The use of English as the primary language of legal discourse is common in Anglophone Africa, where judicial systems are based on the British legal system. This often alienates the people from the law since most of them have little or no facility in English.

司法机构的语言政策不应该阻碍司法公正。在非洲英语国家，将英语作为法律文书的主要语言是十分常见的，因为这些国家的司法体系都以英国的司法体系为基础。这往往导致人民与法律之间产生隔阂，因为他们中的大多数人对英语的掌握程度不高甚至根本不会英语。

> South Africa has attempted to widen choices for non-English and non-Afrikaans speakers by calling for 11 constitutionally recognized official languages. Despite an ambitious court interpreter program that puts most other countries to shame, there is still a bias towards English.

南非已经试图过通过呼吁宪法承认十一种官方语言的方式，来扩大非英语和非非洲裔人群的选择空间。尽管其有一个足以使其他国家感到羞愧的、野心勃勃的法庭口译员计划，但偏向于英语的情况仍然存在。
